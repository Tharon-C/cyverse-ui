The marg style utilitiy allows us to easily expose a set of margin props on our components.
The following properties will take a number 1-10 and return the correct styles for setting the golden ratio from our smallest margin "1" to our largest "10". It is discuraged and might be prevented in later versions but a custom margin size can be set by passing a string value like "10px" or "30%".

### Available Props
- mr = marginRight
- mb = marginBottom
- ml = marginRight
- ms = marginRight, marginLeft
